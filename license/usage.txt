Methods
=======
1. Enabling the Idleness of the application
-------------------------------------------
	
	void SetIdleEnabled(bool bIdle)
	
	-This method is used to notify the License Server that the application is Idle or Not
	
	Vct::License::Client::get().SetIdleEnabled(bool bIdle);

	1. Pass 'false' if application is active   //It keeps sending the Heart Beats to License Server and it denotes that application is active
	2. Pass 'true' if the application is idle  //It will stop sending the Heart Beats to License Server
	
	
	Example:
	For batchmode, 
	-------------
	-Call 'SetIdleEnabled(false)' when the application is started.
	-We don't need to call 'SetIdleEnabled(true)' for batch applications
	
	For Gui Mode,
	-------------
	-Call 'SetIdleEnabled(false)' when the application is launched. It keeps sending the HeartBeats.
	-Call 'SetIdleEnabled(true)' when the application is idle and call 'SetIdleEnabled(false)' when the application is active again
	

2. Getting License Status
-------------------------
	
	int GetCurrentLicenseStatus();
	
	-The method is used to get the status of current license

	int iLicStatus = Vct::License::Client::get().GetCurrentLicenseStatus();
